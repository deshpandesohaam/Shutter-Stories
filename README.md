This project creates a sleek, modern, single-page website for a photographer or creative agency. The most interesting feature is that it's fully interactive—allowing users to switch between a welcome page, a gallery, and a feedback form—using only HTML and CSS. This is achieved through a clever technique often called the "Checkbox Hack," which uses hidden radio buttons and their :checked state to control which content is visible.
